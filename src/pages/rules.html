            <p>Remember: <strong>pissandshitimages.com</strong> is about having fun with intentionally bad image quality, not about pushing boundaries or testing limits. Keep it light, keep it legal, and keep it meme-worthy!</p>

                🎯 FINAL WARNING: "It's just a prank bro" is not a valid defense for rule violations. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes (like getting banned).
